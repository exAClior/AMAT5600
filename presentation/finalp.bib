  abstract = {The 1937 theoretical discovery of Majorana fermions--whose defining property is that they are their own anti-particles--has since impacted diverse problems ranging from neutrino physics and dark matter searches to the fractional quantum Hall effect and superconductivity. Despite this long history the unambiguous observation of Majorana fermions nevertheless remains an outstanding goal. This review article highlights recent advances in the condensed matter search for Majorana that have led many in the field to believe that this quest may soon bear fruit. We begin by introducing in some detail exotic `topological' one- and two-dimensional superconductors that support Majorana fermions at their boundaries and at vortices. We then turn to one of the key insights that arose during the past few years; namely, that it is possible to `engineer' such exotic superconductors in the laboratory by forming appropriate heterostructures with ordinary s-wave superconductors. Numerous proposals of this type are discussed, based on diverse materials such as topological insulators, conventional semiconductors, ferromagnetic metals, and many others. The all-important question of how one experimentally detects Majorana fermions in these setups is then addressed. We focus on three classes of measurements that provide smoking-gun Majorana signatures: tunneling, Josephson effects, and interferometry. Finally, we discuss the most remarkable properties of condensed matter Majorana fermions--the non-Abelian exchange statistics that they generate and their associated potential for quantum computation.},

  abstract = {Majorana zero modes (MZMs) realize a representation of non-abelian braid groups that enable topological quantum computation, wherein the storage and manipulation of information occur in decoherence-free degrees of freedom. This paper is intended to build off existing texts in the topic [1, 2] to serve as an introduction to MZMs at the undergraduate level, providing an overview of many important concepts in condensed matter physics, such as the Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism and topological phases. We provide an overview of the motivation behind finding MZMs and discuss how the nature of these modes can provide an elegant solution to various challenges in quantum computing. We then show how MZMs can appear in a toy model known as a Kitaev wire by solving its spectrum, and conclude with a discussion on the conditions under which they arise in a one-dimensional chain.},

A finite system of length \$L\$ possesses two ground states with an energy difference proportional to \$\textbackslash exp(-L/l\_0)\$ and different fermionic parities. Such systems can be used as qubits since they are intrinsically immune to decoherence. The property of a system to have boundary Majorana fermions is expressed as a condition on the bulk electron spectrum. The condition is satisfied in the presence of an arbitrary small energy gap induced by proximity of a 3-dimensional p-wave superconductor, provided that the normal spectrum has an odd number of Fermi points in each half of the Brillouin zone (each spin component counts separately).},

  abstract = {Shor's algorithm is a quantum computer algorithm for finding the prime factors of an integer. It was developed in 1994 by the American mathematician Peter Shor.On a quantum computer, to factor an integer                         N                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle N\}   , Shor's algorithm runs in polylogarithmic time, meaning the time taken is polynomial in                         log         ⁡         N                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle \textbackslash log N\}   , the size of the integer given as input.

This is almost exponentially faster than the most efficient known classical factoring algorithm, the general number field sieve, which works in sub-exponential time:                         O                             (                        e                            1.9               (               log               ⁡               N                                )                                    1                                        /                                      3                                               (               log               ⁡               log               ⁡               N                                )                                    2                                        /                                      3                                                                   )                          \{\textbackslash displaystyle O\textbackslash!\textbackslash left(e\^\{1.9(\textbackslash log N)\^\{1/3\}(\textbackslash log \textbackslash log N)\^\{2/3\}\}\textbackslash right)\}   . The efficiency of Shor's algorithm is due to the efficiency of the quantum Fourier transform, and modular exponentiation by repeated squarings.If a quantum computer with a sufficient number of qubits could operate without succumbing to quantum noise and other quantum-decoherence phenomena, then Shor's algorithm could be used to break public-key cryptography schemes, such as The RSA scheme The Finite Field Diffie-Hellman key exchange The Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key exchangeRSA is based on the assumption that factoring large integers is computationally intractable. As far as is known, this assumption is valid for classical (non-quantum) computers; no classical algorithm is known that can factor integers in polynomial time. However, Shor's algorithm shows that factoring integers is efficient on an ideal quantum computer, so it may be feasible to defeat RSA by constructing a large quantum computer. It was also a powerful motivator for the design and construction of quantum computers, and for the study of new quantum-computer algorithms. It has also facilitated research on new cryptosystems that are secure from quantum computers, collectively called post-quantum cryptography. In 2001, Shor's algorithm was demonstrated by a group at IBM, who factored                         15                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle 15\}    into                         3         ×         5                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle 3\textbackslash times 5\}   , using an NMR implementation of a quantum computer with                         7                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle 7\}    qubits. After IBM's implementation, two independent groups implemented Shor's algorithm using photonic qubits, emphasizing that multi-qubit entanglement was observed when running the Shor's algorithm circuits. In 2012, the factorization of                         15                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle 15\}    was performed with solid-state qubits. Later, in 2012, the factorization of                         21                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle 21\}    was achieved. In 2019 an attempt was made to factor the number                         35                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle 35\}    using Shor's algorithm on an IBM Q System One, but the algorithm failed because of accumulating errors.  Though larger numbers have been factored by quantum computers using other algorithms, these algorithms are similar to classical brute-force checking of factors, so unlike Shor's algorithm, they are not expected to ever perform better than classical factoring algorithms.},
