  abstract = {The 1937 theoretical discovery of Majorana fermions--whose defining property is that they are their own anti-particles--has since impacted diverse problems ranging from neutrino physics and dark matter searches to the fractional quantum Hall effect and superconductivity. Despite this long history the unambiguous observation of Majorana fermions nevertheless remains an outstanding goal. This review article highlights recent advances in the condensed matter search for Majorana that have led many in the field to believe that this quest may soon bear fruit. We begin by introducing in some detail exotic `topological' one- and two-dimensional superconductors that support Majorana fermions at their boundaries and at vortices. We then turn to one of the key insights that arose during the past few years; namely, that it is possible to `engineer' such exotic superconductors in the laboratory by forming appropriate heterostructures with ordinary s-wave superconductors. Numerous proposals of this type are discussed, based on diverse materials such as topological insulators, conventional semiconductors, ferromagnetic metals, and many others. The all-important question of how one experimentally detects Majorana fermions in these setups is then addressed. We focus on three classes of measurements that provide smoking-gun Majorana signatures: tunneling, Josephson effects, and interferometry. Finally, we discuss the most remarkable properties of condensed matter Majorana fermions--the non-Abelian exchange statistics that they generate and their associated potential for quantum computation.},

  abstract = {Majorana zero modes (MZMs) realize a representation of non-abelian braid groups that enable topological quantum computation, wherein the storage and manipulation of information occur in decoherence-free degrees of freedom. This paper is intended to build off existing texts in the topic [1, 2] to serve as an introduction to MZMs at the undergraduate level, providing an overview of many important concepts in condensed matter physics, such as the Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism and topological phases. We provide an overview of the motivation behind finding MZMs and discuss how the nature of these modes can provide an elegant solution to various challenges in quantum computing. We then show how MZMs can appear in a toy model known as a Kitaev wire by solving its spectrum, and conclude with a discussion on the conditions under which they arise in a one-dimensional chain.},

  abstract = {Certain one-dimensional Fermi systems have an energy gap in the bulk spectrum while boundary states are described by one Majorana operator per boundary point. A finite system of length \$L\$ possesses two ground states with an energy difference proportional to \$\textbackslash exp(-L/l\_0)\$ and different fermionic parities. Such systems can be used as qubits since they are intrinsically immune to decoherence. The property of a system to have boundary Majorana fermions is expressed as a condition on the bulk electron spectrum. The condition is satisfied in the presence of an arbitrary small energy gap induced by proximity of a 3-dimensional p-wave superconductor, provided that the normal spectrum has an odd number of Fermi points in each half of the Brillouin zone (each spin component counts separately).},
