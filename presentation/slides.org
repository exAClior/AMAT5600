* Motivation
** Noise in Quantum Computer
- Quantum Computing has advantage over Classical
- Noise is the archenemy
- Solution: store information *non-locally*
- "If a physical system were to have quantum topological (necessarily nonlocal)
  degrees of freedom, which were insensitive to local probes, then information
  contained in them would be automatically protected against errors caused by
  local interactions with the environment." - A. Kitaev

- Quantum Computers could solve some problems more efficiently compared to
  classical computers. For example, Shor's algorithm is able to factor large
  integers $N$, in \(\mathcal{O}(log(N)^{2}loglog(N)\) time. Meanwhile, the best
  known classical algorithm is \(\mathcal{O}(e^{1.9
  log(N)^{1/3}loglog(N)^{2/3}}\).
- However, this technology is plagued by noise. Roughly speaking, noise is like
  a little daemon who flips the abucus that you use to do calculation. The
  source of those noise come from unwanted physical interaction. or even badly
  calibrated actions.
- For the purpose of this talk, we focus on unwanted physical interaciton.
- This gives us an idea. Since all known physical interactions are local, could
  be store our information non-locally to alleviate the effect of noise?

* Emergence of Majorana Zero Mode

** What is Majorana Femion
- A particle that's its own particle
- \(\gamma = \gamma^{\dagger}\)


** Notes :B_note:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_env: note
:END:
- Why does dephasing correspond to
  \(aa^{\dagger}\)[[cite:&huangIntroductionMajoranaZero2021]]

** Kitaev's Toy Model

** Topological Order
- Reivew
- How did it emerge


* Take Home Message
** Physics and Computation
- "Information is Physical" - R. Landauer
- Topological degree of freedom sees not local perturbation

** Note :B_note:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_env: note
:END:
- Information is physical, meaning that the effecacy of the computation relies
  very much so on the system that realizes it. Computation is not merely
  something on the paper. It's very much so related to the physical world.
- Topological degree of freedom is calculated from the system-wide point of
  view. Therefore, it could not be probed locally hence it's immune to local
  error.
