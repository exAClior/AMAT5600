* Motivation
** My interest: Quantum Computer
- *Motivation*: quantum advantage on some problems
- How does it differ from classical one?
  1) Information encoded on a qubit: \(\ket{\psi} = \alpha \ket{0} + e^{i\theta}
     \beta \ket{1} \)
  2) \(\ket{0}\) and $\ket{1}$ are usually degrees of freedom of underlying
     *physical* system

** Note :B_note:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_env: note
:END:
- Let me first introduce quantum computer for those who are not familiar
- Qubit vs Bit
- Quantum Computers could solve some problems more efficiently compared to
  classical computers. For example, Shor's algorithm is able to factor large
  integers $N$ while providing an exponential speed up compare to classical one.

** Noise in Quantum Computer
- Noise is the archenemy
- *Example*: Imp and abucus
- Caused by unwanted physical interactions

\footnotetext{We refer to all noise loosely by decoherence.}
** Note :B_note:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_env: note
:END:
- However, this technology is plagued by noise. Roughly speaking, noise is like
  a little daemon who flips the abucus that you use to do calculation. The
  source of those noise come from unwanted physical interaction. or even badly
  calibrated actions.
- Loss of phase: $a^{\dagger}_{j}a_{j} = (1+ i \gamma_{2j-1}\gamma)/2$

** Observation and Solution
- *Observation*: Physical interactions are local
- *Proposition*: Design a qubit to store information *non-locally*
- "If a physical system were to have quantum topological (necessarily nonlocal)
  degrees of freedom, which were insensitive to local probes, then information
  contained in them would be automatically protected against errors caused by
  local interactions with the environment." - A. Kitaev

** Note :B_note:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_env: note
:beamer_opt: allowframebreaks
:END:
- This gives us an idea. Since all known physical interactions are local, could
  be store our information non-locally to alleviate the effect of noise?
- The following quote of Alexi Kitaev is too good to be missed

* Topological Protection

** Topological Invariant
[[./TopoInvariant.png]] [Prof. Li Slides]

** Note :B_note:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_env: note
:END:
- This is very abstract, can we get a better intuition from what we have learned
  in class?
- Consider Topological Invariant
- Recall our definition of a topological invariant, as previously defined in
  class. Both the Gauss-Bonnet theorem and the calculation of the Berry phase
  require an integral over the entire system. Local information alone is
  insufficient to determine the topological invariants of a system. Similarly,
  if one has the ability to alter a system locally, they cannot alter the
  topological invariant number of that system.

** Topological Degeneracy
- Defined on low temperature gapped quantum many body system
- Degenerate ground state emerges after phase transition
- Arises from topologically non-trivial phase
- Protected from local perturbation
- Encode qubit onto these d.o.f

** Note :B_note:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_env: note
:END:
- Using this as a guide, we turn our attention to topological systems. In the
  limit of large system size, a topologically non-trivial phase can emerge from
  a gapped quantum many-body system. One key feature of the non-trivial phase is
  that it possesses topologically degenerate ground states that are not
  degenerate in the topologically trivial phase. Therefore, the degeneracy of
  the ground states is a direct consequence of the topology of the system's
  phase. Applying the logic from the previous paragraph, we expect these ground
  states to be protected from local noise, meaning decoherence should not affect
  them.

* Kitaev's Toy Model
** Hamiltonian [[cite:&kitaevUnpairedMajoranaFermions2001]]
- \(H = \sum_{n=1}^{N} [- \mu (a^{\dagger}_{n}a_{n}- \frac{1}{2}) - w
  (a^{\dagger}_{n}a_{n+1} + a^{\dagger}_{n+1}a_{n}) + \Delta a_{n}a_{n+1} +
  \Delta^{*}a^{\dagger}_{n+1}a^{\dagger}_{n})]\)
- 1D chain of fermions
- $\mu$: chemical potential
- $w$: hopping strength
- $\Delta$: induced superconducting gap

** Emergence of Non-trivial Phase [[cite:&huangIntroductionMajoranaZero2021]]
- \( |\Delta| = w > 0\)
- \(a_{n} = \frac{1}{2}(e^{-i \theta /2}\gamma_{2n} +
  e^{i\theta/2}\gamma_{2n-1})\)
- $\gamma$ is the Majorana creation/anhilation operator
- \(\tilde{a}_{n} = (\gamma_{2n}-i\gamma_{2n+1})/2\)
- *Diagonalize*: \(H = 2w \sum_{n=1}^{N-1}(\tilde{a}^{\dagger}_{n}\tilde{a}_{n} -1/2)\)

** A picture is worth a thousand words

** Note :B_note:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_env: note
:END:
- Note, $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_{2N}$ are not in Hamiltonian
- Have zero energy.
- Combine to make fermonic mode \(\tilde{a}_{0} =(\gamma_{1}+i\gamma_{2N})/2\)
- $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$ of above creation operator have degenerate energy.
- Also protected by topology. Can be made into protected qubits!

* Take Home Message
** Physics and Computation
- "Information is Physical" [[cite:&landauerThereAreNo1991]]
- Topologically degenerate degree of freedom sees not local perturbation
\footnotetext{*MZM* is not Majorana fermion.}

** Note :B_note:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_env: note
:END:
- Information is physical, meaning that the effecacy of the computation relies
  very much so on the system that realizes it. Computation is not merely
  something on the paper. It's very much so related to the physical world.
- Topological degree of freedom is calculated from the system-wide point of
  view. Therefore, it could not be probed locally hence it's immune to local
  error.
